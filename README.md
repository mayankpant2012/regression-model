# regression-model
This project deals with estimating the CO2 Emissions for a newly manufactured car by making Regression models which can accurately predetermine the car CO2 emissions before it is being launched. 
The predictions are done based on the various features and specifications of the car.

<b>Open the CO2_emission_regression.ipynb file. All operations are performed in the file.</b>
- Dataset is extracted from the <b>CO2_emission.csv</b> file.
<h3>Description of dataset:</h3>

  - YEAR – Year of manufacturing of car.

- MAKE – Manufacturing company name.

- VEHICLECLASS – Type of vehicle like SUV or medium sized etc.

- ENGINESIZE – Size of the car’s engine (expressed in cc or cubic centimetre).

- CYLINDERS – Number of Cylinders in the engine.

- TRANSMISSION – Automatic or manual transmission with number of gears.

- FUELTYPE – It indicates the type of fuel car use i.e. Diesel, Petrol, Z (Unleaded Petrol) etc.

- FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY – Fuel consumption or Fuel economy of car while running in city expressed in miles per gallon.

- FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY - Fuel Consumption or Fuel economy of car on highway expressed in miles per gallon.

- FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB – Net or combination of Fuel Economy expressed in miles per gallon.

- FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG – Total fuel economy expressed in miles per gallon.

- CO2EMISSIONS – The CO2 emitted by the car expressed in grams.


<b> This Data is then analysed and then a Machine Learning model is fit on it.
 These ML models are created using python libraries.</b>
